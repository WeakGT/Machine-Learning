\section{Attribute Settings of the Random Forest Model}
\subsection{Number of Trees}
I used $5$ trees in the random forest model.

\subsection{Number of Features}
I used $\lfloor\sqrt{n_{\text{features}}}\rfloor = \lfloor\sqrt{30}\rfloor = 5$ features for each decision tree.

\subsection{Number of Instances}
The model was trained on $\lfloor n_{\text{samples}} \times 0.8 \rfloor = 5440$ instances, using 80\% of the available data.

\section{Difficulty Encountered}
One challenge I encountered was that the F1-score submitted to Kaggle did not reach a satisfactory level (the baseline score is 0.7), which stuck with me for a long time.

\section{Solutions and Reflections}
After experimenting with a variety of hyperparameters, the best result was achieved with 5 trees and a maximum depth of 3 for each tree.
