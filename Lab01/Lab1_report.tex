\section{Regression Equation}
$$y=\Phi(X)\mathbf{w}$$
where $\Phi_j(x)=x^j$ is a polynomial function.

\section{Variables and Regression Equation in Advance Part}
I used all given variables and processed outliers with IQR truncation. The equation is same as the basic part, excluding the degree. I used a higher degree to try to catch more features and get a better $w$.

\section{Difficulty Encountered}
At the beginning, the cost got larger after iterations, sometimes it became NaN and got overflow exception.

\section{Solutions and Reflections}
I adjusted a lot of parameters. After a long time, I found that the learning rate is too large to handle the gradient decent. Then I picked a smaller learning rate, it worked.
After the lab, I reflected that the learning rate could not be too large at first. We should pick a small value first. If it worked, we adjusted it larger.
